# Slanter.jl - Reorder matrices rows and columns to move high values close to the diagonal.

`Slanter.jl <https://github.com/tanaylab/Slanter.jl>`_ is a Julia package which provides an API for reordering matrices
rows and columns to move high values close to the diagonal. This is a port to Julia of the
`Slanter R package <https://github.com/tanaylab/slanter>`_. See that package for detailed documentation with examples.
The (terse) Julia is [here](https://tanaylab.github.io/Slanter.jl/v0.1.0).

## Installation

Just `Pkg.add("Slanter")`, like installing any other Julia package.
